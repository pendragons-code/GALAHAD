# GALAHAD
  An autoclicker that will soon come with plenty of features!   
  
  **NAVBAR** 
  
  An autoclicking tool that is made in python.
  To run: `python3 GALAHAD.py`
  Due to multiple requests, I will be changing some stuff soon with some minecraft releated presets since someone told me they saw a potential use of being a cobblestone miner in minecraft. (The way it works is that the durations for lava flowing to water, rate of diffent pickaxes break the cobblestone, durability of tool and automating the process of opening the inventory and moving stuff around. accounting all these, this may beome a really good farming tool since pyautogui has features for hlding a key/button down.)    
      
  ``` 
  git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/GALAHAD
  ``` 
  **Power Users ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘‰:**  
  As usual manipulate your .bashrc file or make an executable to get the stuff working.  
  
  **Benchmarks and requests:**  
  
  Yup I get it, you wanna see proof that this piece of shit of a program does in fact work. I will be posting this on instagram. And maybe like LISBDIE, I'll make a gif/video to show you how fast this thing is. I was using a raspberry pi and it hit rates I never thought was possible.
  
  # Details
